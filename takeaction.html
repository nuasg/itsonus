               		<li><strong>Notice the incident.</strong> Bystanders first must notice the incident taking place. It's important to become attune to what situations may be risky; i.e., if you're at a party, and you see someone stumbling as they're being led into a different room, this is a risky situation. 
 </li>
 					<p></p>
               		<li><strong>Interpret the situation as an emergency.</strong> By "emergency," we mean a situation wherein there is risk of sexual or domestic violence occurring in the near future.
</li>
               		<p></p>
               		<li><strong>Assume responsibility for intervening.</strong> It has been found that often, people believe that someone else will help in a situation where there are many poeple around. However, it is important to realize that others may also be thinking the same thing. If you're unsure if you should do something, ask a friend what they think -- it might be the case that they've been thinking the same thing.
</li>
               		<p></p>
               		<li><strong>Have the bystander intervention skills to help.</strong> There are a number of different techniques that someone can use to intervene in a risky situation, some of which we've listed below.

                <p><em>Please remember that your safety is of the utmost importance. When a situation that threatens physical harm to yourself or another student, ask someone for help or contact local police.</em></p>
                <p class="lead">
               		<ol id="resourcelist">
               		<li><strong>Direct:</strong> Step in and address the situation directly. This might look like saying, "That's not cool. Please stop," or "Hey, leave them alone." This technique tends to work better when the person that you're trying to stop is someone that knows and trusts you. It does not work well when drugs or alcohol are being used because someone's ability to have a conversation with you about what is going on may be impaired, and they are more likely to become defensive.</li>
               		<p></p>
               		<li><strong>Distract:</strong> Distract either person in the situation to intervene. This might look like saying, "Hey, aren't you in my Spanish class?" or "Who wants to get pizza?" This technique is especially useful when drugs or alcohol are being used because people under the influence are more easily distracted than those who are sober.</li>
               		<p></p>
               		<li><strong>Delegate:</strong> Find others who can help you to intervene in the situation. This might look like asking a friend to distract one person in the situation while you distract the other ("splitting" or "defensive split"), asking someone to go sit with them and talk, or going and starting a dance party right in the middle of their conversation. If you don't know either person in the situation, you can also ask around to see if someone else does and would check in with them. See if they can go talk to their friend, text them, or do something else to intervene.</li>
               		<p></p>
               		<li><strong>Delay:</strong> For many reasons, you may not be able to do something right in the moment. For example, if you're feeling unsafe or if you're unsure whether or not someone in the situation is feeling unsafe, you may just want to check in with the person. In this case, you can come a distraction technique by asking the person to go use the restroom with you or get a drink with you to separate them from the person they are talking with. Then, you might ask them "Are you okay?" or "How can I help you get out of this situation?" This could also look like texting the person, either in that moment or after you see them leave and asking, "Are you okay?" or "Do you need help?"</li>
